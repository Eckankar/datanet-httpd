# datanet-httpd

A simple HTTPd I implemented for the course Datanet at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk) in 2010.

This is student code implemented for a university course, so it's not at all production ready.

# Requirements

Requires Python 2.

# Usage

To start the server, execute `./httpd.py`.

Commandline switches are available through `./httpd.py -h`.

Per default it runs on port 8080 in verbose mode.
